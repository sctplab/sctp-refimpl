This is the reference implementation for SCTP. It is
portable and runs on FreeBSD/MAC-OS/Windows and in User Space (including
linux). It is full featured and offers all of the features found in the SCTP
RFC's as well as some new drafts. It is actively maintained by many
of the draft and RFC authors.
